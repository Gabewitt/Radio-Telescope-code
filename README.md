# This Project was part of our Third Year Project Module at King's College London.

## Description of the Porject

Our group, lead by Prof. Jeffrey Grube, intended to experimentally use the already built Radio Telescope, to measure the Doppler shift of detected 21.1cm Hydrogen Line to then plot the rotation curve of the Milky Way Galaxy. We ended up building our own telescope due to questionable data from the original telescope.

## Description of the Code

The Code was written by my professor and myself where it took the csv files generated by the software we were using, and it produces rotation curves by calculating the maximum velocity of each measurment, for each angle of the telescope. There are three different code files each computing the data from the different telescopes we used. Salsa being the dish telescope we used at a distance which are based in sweden, Horn is the new telescope our group built, and the dish telescope being the old telescope.
